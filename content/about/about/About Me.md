# Hi, I'm Aaditya 👋  

(Pronounced **Ah-di-ti-ya**—but you can call me **Aadi** if that's easier!)  

I love **building cool things with open-source technologies**. My primary interests are:  
- **High-performance databases** 🏎️  
- **Leveraging AI for better consumer products** 🧠✨  
- **Computer science research in my spare time** 📖  

Beyond tech, I enjoy **skiing and hiking** in the mountains near **Salt Lake City** 🏔️⛷️.
